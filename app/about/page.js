          Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Ava Abadian</strong> â€” a Cognitive Science major with a specialization in Design & Interaction at UC San Diego.
          I started as a pre-med student studying neuroscience, but eventually found my passion in the world of design.
          Now Iâ€™m exploring how I can bring together the brain and behavior with the art of human-centered design.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', lineHeight: '1.6', marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
          Iâ€™m still growing in this field and excited to keep learning â€” I see myself as a lifelong learner whoâ€™s curious about everything.
          If I could have a superpower, it would be knowing everything about every field (seriously!).
          Whether itâ€™s design, science, or the human experience, I want to keep evolving.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem', lineHeight: '1.6', marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
          Outside of school and work, I love photography, traveling, being in nature, working out, and listening to music.
          One of my biggest dreams is to build a career that lets me work remotely, see the world, and one day give back to my parents â€”
          because everything Iâ€™m doing now is all because of their love and sacrifices. ðŸ’›
        </p>
