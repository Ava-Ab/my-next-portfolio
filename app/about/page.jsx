      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: '1.6', color: '#222' }}>
        Hi! I’m <strong>Ava Abadian</strong> — a Cognitive Science major at UC San Diego specializing in
        Design & Interaction. My academic path has taken many turns, from premed to
        neuroscience, and now I have discovered my love for design. I’m especially drawn to
        human-centered design and how we can use it to make technology more accessible,
        intuitive, and impactful.
      </p>

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: '1.6', color: '#222' }}>
        I’m still new in my design journey and learning as much as I can. I’m passionate about
        merging my background in science with user experience, especially creating tools
        that help students and people dealing with anxiety, ADHD, or other cognitive
        disadvantages. I hope to become a designer who brings empathy into every step of
        the process, always listening, learning, and designing with intention and care.
      </p>

      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem', lineHeight: '1.6', color: '#222' }}>
        Outside of design, I love photography, stargazing, nature, music, staying active, and
        traveling. I dream of a remote-friendly career that allows me to see the world while
        supporting my family, especially giving back to my parents, whose sacrifices made
        my education and future possible.
      </p>
